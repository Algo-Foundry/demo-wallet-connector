# Wallet Connector Demo
Please note that MyAlgo and Pera Algo Wallet (WalletConnect) requires you to create accounts in TestNet and fund them to carry out transactions. Use the [dispenser](https://bank.testnet.algorand.network/) to fund your accounts first.

This demo requires you to have at least 2 accounts for each connector (sender and receiver).
